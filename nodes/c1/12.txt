Build Abstraction with Functions

1.2 Elements of programming 
i. Programming language serves as a framework where organized our ideas about computational processes.
ii. Three mechanisms of programming language:
primitive expressions and statements
means of combination
means of abstraction
iii. two kinds of elements:
functions(describe the rules for manipulating data)
data(stuffs we want to manipulate)


Expressions 
Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive built-in data values and functions

Call expressions 

Names and Environment
=: assignment operator, simplest way of abstraction(use simple name for the results of compound operations)

Evaluating Nested Expressions
provides a means of combining operations

Pure Function: no effects beyond a return value
benifits:
1. be composed more reliably into compound call expressions( used effectively in nested expressions)
2. simpler to test 
3. essential for writing concurrent programs

pure functions interact only via the values they take and return
